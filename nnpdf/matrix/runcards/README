The distributions and dddistributions include all the implemented distributions as of 18-03-2025.

The model runcard uses values from PDG and as agreed upon in the theory settings.
It currently uses tha top mass of 172.5. For grids with varied mass, modify this accordingly.

The parameter runcard seeks a precision of 0.02%.

The scale choices include a custom choice (70) which uses the H_T/4 where the mass of top is fixed to 172.5 GeV.
