# eg: cluster_submit_line1 = "#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4000"

# eg: cluster_submit_line2 = "source /PATH/"
# or: cluster_submit_line3 = "export YOUR_FAVOURITE_VARIABLE=/PATH/"
#
# You can add as many lines as you want of the structure "cluster_submit_lineX", where X
# is a number which defines the order of the lines added to the submission file.
# If you want/need to use "#", "%" or "=" signs you need to put quotes around the line: "#blah" !
